    <h1>Parallax</h1>
    <div class="parallax" id="firstimage"></div>

    <div class="text-content" id="bigsize">
      <p>The parallax effect is the displacement of two images' positions, which is achieved by moving them at different rates
      compared to the viewer's perspective. This is a popular technique in web development and is also one of the
      primary techniques used to help achieve 3D effects in 3D movies (I noticed it pretty dramatically when I was watching
      the mountains of Mars in the opening landscape sequence of "The Martian").</p>
      <p>The above above image is hidden behind this content block as you scroll.</p>
      <p>The key to the parallax effect is the CSS property "background attachment". This determines whether, if a
      background image is specified, it should be fixed in the viewport with scrolling or whether it should follow
      the viewport.</p>
      <p>By default, background attachment is set to "scroll", which means that the background will scroll along with the div element that it inhabits. But if it's set to "fixed", it will stick to the viewport itself, allowing for the cool parallax effect to occur.</p>
      <p>Below, another image appears between the content blocks as part of the parallax scrolling.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="parallax" id="secondimage"></div>
    <div class="text-content" id="smallsize">
      <p>This small content div shows that the image being hidden by the parallax is hidden by all subsequent elements on
        the page, and not just the immediately following element.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div ng-class="{'active': toggleClass}" id="thirdimage"></div>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>Also, be sure to set a min-height for your parallax image, or you're going to have a bad day.
      Push the button to toggle the min-height for the swamp-dog image above on or off. Neat!</p>
      <button class="button" ng-click="toggleHeight()">Toggle Fixed Image Height</button>
      <p>That's the basics of making the parallax effect. Thanks for checking out my example site!</p>
