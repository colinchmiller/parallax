    <div class="text-content">
      <p>The parallax effect is the displacement of two images' positions achieved by moving them at different rates
      in comparison to the viewer's perspective. This is a popular technique in web development and is also one of the
      primary techniques of helping to achieve 3D effects in 3D movies (a good example being the opening landscape shot
      sequence in The Martian).</p>
      <p>The above above image is hidden behind this content block as you scroll.</p>
      <p>The key to the parallax effect is the CSS property "background attachment". This determines whether, if a
      background image is specified, it should be fixed in the viewport with scrolling or whether it should follow
      the viewport.</p>
      <p>Below, another image appears between the content blocks as part of the parallax scrolling.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="parallax" id="secondimage"></div>
    <div class="text-content" id="smallsize">
      <p>This small content div shows that the image being hidden by the parallax is hidden by all subsequent elements on
        the page, and not just the immediately following element.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="parallax" id="thirdimage"></div>
    <div class="text-content">
      <p>Also, be sure to set a min-height for your parallax image, or you're going to have a bad day.
      Push the button to toggle the min-height for the swamp-dog image above on or off. Neat!</p>
      <button class="button" ng-click="toggleHeight()">Button</button>
      <p>That's the basics of making the parallax effect. Thanks for checking out my example site!</p>
